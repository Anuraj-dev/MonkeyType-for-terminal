- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly typed characters
- **Consistency**: Variation in your typing rhythm
- **Error Count**: Total mistakes made during session

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Configuration

### CLI Flags

| Flag                | Description                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `--timed SECONDS`   | Timed session (mutually exclusive with `--words`) |
| `--words COUNT`     | Fixed number of words                             |
| `--punct FLOAT`     | Punctuation probability 0..1 (e.g. 0.1)           |
| `--numbers`         | Enable occasional number replacement              |
| `--list PATH`       | Custom word list file path                        |
| `--show-highscores` | Display highscores and exit                       |

### Available Word Lists

The game includes several pre-made difficulty levels:

- **`easy.txt`**: 36 short common words
- **`medium.txt`**: 36 moderate length words
- **`hard_words.txt`**: 54 complex vocabulary words
- **`programming.txt`**: 53 technical programming terms
- **`alice_words.txt`**: 283 words from Alice in Wonderland
- **`english_1k.txt`**: Original mixed word list

### Creating Custom Difficulty Levels

1. **Add words to a file** (one per line):

```
sophisticated
implementation
extraordinary
# ... more words
```

2. **Save in** `data/wordlists/my_difficulty.txt`

3. **Update the difficulty chooser** in `engine.py` to include your new list

### Book Content Support

The game can convert any book or text into typing practice:

1. **Paste book content** into `data/wordlists/book_name.txt`
2. **Run converter**: `python convert_book.py`
3. **Generated file**: `book_name_words.txt` (one word per line)
4. **Add to difficulty menu** for easy access

## üìà Highscore System

### Smart Storage Logic

- **Improvement-Based**: Highscores only saved when you beat your previous best
- **No File Spam**: Prevents cluttering with poor performances
- **First-Time Saves**: Always records your initial attempt for comparison
- **Local Storage**: `highscores.json` in project directory (or home fallback)

### Highscore Ranking

Each mode creates a separate leaderboard (e.g., `timed-60-p0-n1`):

1. **Net WPM** (descending - primary ranking)
2. **Accuracy** (descending - tiebreaker)
3. **Timestamp** (ascending - older first for final ties)

### Progress Tracking

The enhanced end screen shows:

```
Previous Best Net WPM: 45.20
üéâ IMPROVEMENT: +3.15 WPM!
*** NEW HIGHSCORE SAVED! ***
```

Or for non-improvements:

```
üìâ Below best by 2.10 WPM
üí° No highscore saved (no improvement)
```

## üßÆ Metrics Formulas

### Standard WPM Calculations

- **Raw (Gross) WPM** = `(total_chars_typed / 5) / minutes_elapsed`
- **Net WPM** = `((correct_chars - errors) / 5) / minutes_elapsed` (‚â• 0)
- **Accuracy** = `correct_chars / total_chars_typed` (0 if no chars typed)

### Enhanced Error Detection

- **Character Errors**: Each wrong character counts as 1 error
- **Omission Errors**: Each missing character counts as 1 error
- **Total Characters**: Includes typed chars + omitted chars for accurate metrics
- **Consistency**: Standard deviation of per-word typing times
